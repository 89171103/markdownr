# Uvod

<font size="4">Hi everyone, in this project we will talk about the avocados.Also known as an alligator pear or butter fruit, the versatile avocado is the only fruit that provides a substantial amount of healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Avocados are a naturally nutrient-dense food and contain nearly 20 vitamins and minerals.

  It is a well known fact that Millenials LOVE Avocado Toast. It's also a well known fact that all Millenials live in their parents basements.

Clearly, they aren't buying home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast!
  
  But maybe there's hopeâ€¦ if a Millenial could find a city with cheap avocados, they could live out the Millenial American Dream.

The main focus for this project will be analyzing the data from our avocado sales in the paste few years in different regions.
